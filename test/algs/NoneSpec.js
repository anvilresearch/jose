   *   JWSs MAY also be created that do not provide integrity protection.
   *   Such a JWS is called an Unsecured JWS.  An Unsecured JWS uses the
   *   "alg" value "none" and is formatted identically to other JWSs, but
   *   MUST use the empty octet sequence as its JWS Signature value.
   *   Recipients MUST verify that the JWS Signature value is the empty
   *   octet sequence.
   *
   *   Implementations that support Unsecured JWSs MUST NOT accept such
   *   objects as valid unless the application specifies that it is
   *   acceptable for a specific object to not be integrity protected.
   *   Implementations MUST NOT accept Unsecured JWSs by default.  In order
   *   to mitigate downgrade attacks, applications MUST NOT signal
   *   acceptance of Unsecured JWSs at a global level, and SHOULD signal
   *   acceptance on a per-object basis.  See Section 8.5 for security
   *   considerations associated with using this algorithm.
