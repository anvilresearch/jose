     * 4.  JSON Web Key (JWK) Format
     * https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-4
     *
     *   A JWK is a JSON object that represents a cryptographic key.  The
     *   members of the object represent properties of the key, including its
     *   value.  This JSON object MAY contain whitespace and/or line breaks
     *   before or after any JSON values or structural characters, in
     *   accordance with Section 2 of RFC 7159 [RFC7159].  This document
     *   defines the key parameters that are not algorithm specific and, thus,
     *   common to many keys.
     *
     *   In addition to the common parameters, each JWK will have members that
     *   are key type specific.  These members represent the parameters of the
     *   key.  Section 6 of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification
     *   defines multiple kinds of cryptographic keys and their associated
     *   members.
     *
     *   The member names within a JWK MUST be unique; JWK parsers MUST either
     *   reject JWKs with duplicate member names or use a JSON parser that
     *   returns only the lexically last duplicate member name, as specified
     *   in Section 15.12 (The JSON Object) of ECMAScript 5.1 [ECMAScript].
     *
     *   Additional members can be present in the JWK; if not understood by
     *   implementations encountering them, they MUST be ignored.  Member
     *   names used for representing key parameters for different keys types
     *   need not be distinct.  Any new member name should either be
     *   registered in the IANA "JSON Web Key Parameters" registry established
     *   by Section 8.1 or be a value that contains a Collision-Resistant
     *   Name.

     *   When a key is used to wrap another key and a public key use
